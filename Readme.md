# CSV File Filter
This Python script analyzes a CSV file containing real estate sale prices. It performs the following tasks:

1.Checks for and removes rows with null values in the 'sq__ft' column.
2.Calculates the average price per square foot.
3.Filters properties with prices less than the average price per square foot.
4.Writes the filtered data to a new CSV file named filtered-properties.csv.

## How to Use
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

1.Install the required library (pandas) if not already installed using the following:
   pip install pandas
   
2.Run the script in the command line with the path of the CSV file you want to filter as an argument. For example:
    python script_name.py file_path.csv
    
Replace script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script and file_path.csv with the path to your CSV file.v


```python

```
